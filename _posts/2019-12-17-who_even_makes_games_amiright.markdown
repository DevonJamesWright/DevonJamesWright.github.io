So. The whole reason I decided to start programming. You guys know that very first memory you have of life? Like, the first moment when you were completely aware of your surroundings, when everything stopped melding together and became a cohesive existence? Well,  mine happened right in the middle of me playing Donkey Kong 64 at my 4th birthday party. Video games have literally been a part of  my life since cohesive existence. I have always been an imaginative individual, and I've always wondered how I could implement my imagination into my reality. With coding, I feel like making the impossible, posisble, has been the primary directive of the entire skill since the very beginning, and with that in mind, I head onwards, ready to explore the unknown, ready to face down any boss, any mob spawn, or any obstacles that stand between me and my dream.
