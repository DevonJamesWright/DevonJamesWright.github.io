If i told you that after a month of coding that you'd start having to take a second and think when you heard words you've heard your whole life in order to process what someone just said to you, would you belive me?
def misbelief
  if user.believe
	user.stop_reading
	else 
	continue_reading 
	end 
end 

While those who can read it, know it makes no sense out of context. That little fragment of code is how things work, at least in Ruby. One of the greatest challenge you face with software development in the early stages is implementing logic, or turning English into Code. One of the methods I've subconsciously developed is an alarm that goes off every time I say a keyword, conditional words like "if","when", even reading quotation marks, it all FEELS different. you have this rewiring in your head, almost like a switch turning on. Many people will tell you the magic begins when you create your first application, but I think it starts the first time you start a text message with "def", or you put quotation marks to write something you're trying to say, like " "Hey"  ". To some degree, it IS magic. Arthur C. Clarke famously said that "Sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic. But to the novice, all science is indistinguishable from magic." As you take your first steps away from being a novice, never forget the magic behind the apps, and the magician behind the keyboard.
